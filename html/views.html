        <h2>Views on the Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam</h2>

		<ul class="staticcontent">
			<li><strong>Sir Asutosh Mookerjee</strong>, Judge, High Court, Calcutta: I have for many years past felt the deepest admiration for the excellence of the Work accomplished by the talented founder of the Sri Vani Vilas Press and I have felt it my duty to visit the institution during my brief stay at Trichinopoly. I feel convinced that all Indians may legitimately take pride in the manner the great task has been carried out and the self-sacrifice it has involved. The Memorial Edition of the works of Sankaracharya would, by itself, justify the highest approbation of all scholars.</li>
			<li><strong>Babu Bipin Chandra Pal</strong>strong>: Through the kind courtesy of Mr. Balasubrahmanyam the Proprietor of the Sri Vani Vilasa Press, I was able to look over the numerous valuable works published by it. The selection, compilation, and arrangement of the publications speak highly of the education, culture, and critical discrimination of the Proprietor who is also the editor of most of the publications, while the get-up speaks very highly of the printer’s art which the Press evidently commands.</li>
			<li><strong>Rao Bahadur V.T. Krishnamachariar</strong>: I have this day renewed my acquaintance with this Press. For years Mr. Balasubramania Iyer has been, at great self-sacrifice, publishing our classics in a style which would do credit to the best publishing firms in the West.</li>
			<li><strong>Mrs. Annie Besant</strong>: All lovers of Sanskrit know the exquisite printing of this press, and know also the devotion and the self-sacrifice which make sacred its work.</li>
			<li><strong>Dr. F. Otto Schrader, Ph.D</strong>: Mr. T.K. Balasubrahmanyam, Proprietor of the Sri Vani Vilas Press at Srirangam, is one of the most prominent publishers of Sanskrit Works in Southern India. His Memorial Edition of Sri Sankara Acharya’s Works (20 Vols) is really admirable. His "Sastra Series" the latest volume of which is Venkatanatha’s extensive and valuable commentary on the Bhagavadgita, contains only noteworthy and hitherto unpublished works and is edited very neatly and accurately.</li>
			<li><strong>Hon’ble Mr. P.S. Sivaswamy Aiyar, C.S.I., C.I.E</strong>: Your edition of the Kutuhala Vritti is a scholarly work and the get-up is worthy of the reputation of your press. It goes without saying that your publications are excellently well got-up, quite unlike the coarse unattractive style of Sanskrit Publications generally.</li>
			<li><strong>Rao Bhadur M. Rangacharya, M.A</strong>: I am glad that you are continuing the labour of love in bringing out worthy and valuable Sanskrit Publications. The accuracy and artistic get-up of the publications of the Srirangam Sri Vani Vilas Press are widely known and recognised; and the help you are rendering through them to the development of Sanskrit Scholarship and the unearthing of buried literary treasures of the past is indeed very considerable. The fact that unaided you have done so much so well, is convincing proof to me that your hands deserve to be strengthened by adequately bestowed aid. I think you ought to seek aid from all those who are interested in the cause of India’s ancient learning and are in a position to give the needed aid.</li>
			<li><strong>Mr. S. Kuppuswami Sastrigal, M.A.</strong>: I am glad to be able to bear testimony to the excellent work which the Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam, has been doing for the past ten years. The Press has conferred on the world of Sanskrit scholars an inestimable boon by bringing out correct and critical editions to many rare and hitherto unpublished Sanskrit works, with the co-operation of many eminent Sanskrit scholars.</li>
			<li><strong>Hon’ble Mr. T.K. Seshagiri Aiyar</strong>: You are doing excellent service to the cause of Sanskrit Literature. You are yourself a good scholar and you have resolved to devote your life to the work you have taken in hand. I know personally some of the men who assist you and the work of discriminative editing cannot be in safer hands. For neatness and typographical accuracy, there is none in the whole of India which can excel yours and I say this with complete knowledge of the various publications from all parts of India.</li>
			<li><strong>The Madras Mail</strong>: The Sri Vani Vilas Press of Srirangam has been helping the cause of the advancement of Sanskrit Literature, and its admirable publications of valuable classical works have been the means by which Sanskrit knowledge has been more widely disseminated. Several ancient works, chiefly on Mimamsa and Vedanta, of great literary merit and value, which were hitherto supposed to have been lost, have been unearthed by the energy of Mr. T.K. Balasubrahmanya Aiyar and the Pandits associated with him and made available to the Public.</li>
			<li><strong>The Hindu</strong>: That this extremely useful work (Kutuhala Vritti) is now brought to light for the first time is due to the untiring efforts of the Sri Vani Vilas Press at the resuscitation of all that is rare and precious in the field of Sanskrit literature. The Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam, have published this edition (Kavyalankarasutra Vritti) and their name is a guarantee for everything excellent in publications of this kind. The publications are no common literary critics.</li>
			<li><strong>Louis H. Gray, Esq., Newark, USA</strong>: I can very conscientiously say that it (Vasavadatta) is one of the most admirable editions I have over seen from an Indian Press.</li>
